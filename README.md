## 📖 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to **secure Azure cloud infrastructure** using industry best practices and compliance frameworks. Key security measures include:

*   **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**: Configuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Privileged Identity Management (PIM).
*   **Azure Policy & Governance**: Enforcing compliance standards and security policies.
*   **Network Security**: Implementing **NSGs, firewalls, and encryption** for data protection.
*   **Security Monitoring**: Utilizing **Azure Security Center** and **Azure Monitor** for threat detection and response.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Security**: Automating security configurations with **Terraform & ARM Templates**.
